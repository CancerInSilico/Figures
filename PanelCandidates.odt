Visualization of basic cell simulation

Number of Cells – 100 to 712
Density – 0.1 to 0.733
Runtime – 160 hours






































effect of boundary of cell growth
notice the contact inhibition begins before hard cut off of boundary
























effect of syncing the cycles at the beginning of interphase





















































12 different cycle lengths all seeded at the same density (with boundary)
each simulation reaches same total number of cells at different rates






















































7 different initial densities with the same growth rate
each simulation hits the same hard cutoff around 75% density
(max density effected by delta parameter)




























































amount of contact inhibition at each density
measured by percent increase in cell cycle length
























































contact inhibition in the general case

7 different initial densities run for 168 hours
previous plot shows all stop around same density
identical growth at low densities, begin to diverge once contact inhibition occurs






















































nG = number monte carlo steps in between each growth trial
efficiency related to contact inhibition

efficiency = number accepted growth trials / number attempted growth trials
cycle length is accurate when efficiency is 100%
