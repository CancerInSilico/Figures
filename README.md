# CancerInSilico Figures

This repository contains the figures used for "CancerInSilico: An R/Bioconductor package for combining mathematical and statistical modeling to simulate time course bulk and single cell gene expression data in cancer". The pre-print can be found here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/12/14/328807.full.pdf

The figures, along with the R script to generate them, are each contained in their own folder. Running the R script in full will produce the figures.
